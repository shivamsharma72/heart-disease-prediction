# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic features. It compares multiple classifiers and concludes with a mock deployment using a Flask API.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection using data-driven methods can help save lives. This project focuses on using various machine learning models to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

- **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** consistently performed among the best across accuracy and AUC metrics.
- The final model was saved as `heart_disease_classification_model.pkl`.
- A **mock API using Flask** was implemented, where users can post patient data in JSON format and receive a prediction in return.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

- GridSearchCV used to tune parameters like:
  - `n_estimators`, `max_depth` (RF)
  - `learning_rate`, `max_depth` (GBM)
- Resulted in performance gains compared to default settings

### 5. Deployment Mock

- Final model saved as `heart_disease_classification_model.pkl`
- Flask API accepts POST requests and returns predictions as JSON
- Demonstrates how to transition from notebook to deployable ML service

### 6. Next Steps

- Add feature importance visualization
- Integrate cross-validation and stratification
- Expand Flask app with data validation, exception handling, and logging
